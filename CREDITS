I would like to thank Shane Smith for designing a beautiful new icon for SafariSpeed!
Many thanks to the MacNN Forums members who helped me to test a beta of SafariSpeed 1.2, and continue to help with development in other ways.
I would also like to thank the countless websites who have featured this application.

I appreciate SourceForge.net's generosity in hosting this project.

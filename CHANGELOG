Version 1.2.1
* Decided to keep a log of changes
* Fixed the "Application" text in the menubar - thanks to Krusty from MacNN for pointing this out!
* Fixed a typo in the "Page Loading Delay" window - it's "do" not "to"
* Added a beautiful new icon designed by Shane Smith - Thank You!
* Application now quits on window close - thanks to MacNN's Adam Betts for pointing this out.
